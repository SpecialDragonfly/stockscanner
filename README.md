stockscanner
============

My first stock scanner.

Project aims to be a lightweight stock scanner using yahoo finance data. As much as
possible should be done in client side libraries and as much as possible should be
hosted in CDNs. There's no database requirement for this project at all, nor should
there ever be.

The idea is that this project should be quick to set up, requiring the minimum of
space.

Modern browser support only. (IE9+, FF v18, Chrome v24)
